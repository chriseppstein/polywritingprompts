# Poly Writing Prompts

I've been in a polyamorous marriage for a couple years now. I don't consider myself an expert on the subject but I've been told by poly people who have been doing this for 15 or more years that I've got a good philosophy and instincts about relationships.

Poly relationships are just relationships so please feel free to ask any relationship questions you might have, even if it doesn't pertain to polyamory -- It's my experience that most everything I've learned about poly relationships applies equally to monogamous relationships.

What should I write about? Here's some general categories that I sometimes feel qualified to discuss:

<table>

<ul>
<li> Communication      
<li> Time management    
<li> Sex positivity

<li> Love               
<li> Casual Relationshps
<li> Friendships        
<li> Poly Parenting     
<li> Dating  
</ul>

<li> Opening up a long term relationship
<li> Jealousy                           
<li> Envy                               
<li> Possessiveness                     
<li> Insecurity                         
<li> Fears                              
<li> Anger                              
</ul>
