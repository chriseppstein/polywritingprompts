# Poly Writing Prompts

I've been in a polyamorous marriage for a couple years now. I don't consider myself an expert on the subject but I've been told by poly people who have been doing this for 15 or more years that I've got a good philosophy and instincts about relationships.

Poly relationships are just relationships so please feel free to ask any relationship questions you might have, even if it doesn't pertain to polyamory -- It's my experience that most everything I've learned about poly relationships applies equally to monogamous relationships.

What should I write about? Here's some general categories that I may be qualified to discuss:

* Communication
* Time management
* Sex positivity
* Gender
* Love
* Casual Relationshps
* Friendships
* Poly Parenting
* Dating
* Relationship Rules
* Opening up a long term relationship
* Jealousy
* Envy
* Possessiveness
* Insecurity
* Fears
* Anger
